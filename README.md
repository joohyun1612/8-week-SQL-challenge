**1. How many pizzas were ordered?**

**6. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)**

SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK from registration_date), COUNT(runner_id) AS amount_signed_up
FROM pizza_runner.runners
GROUP BY 1;

**7. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**

WITH time_taken_cte AS

(
  
  SELECT 
    c.order_id, 
    c.order_time,

)

SELECT 
  runner_id, AVG(pickup_minutes) AS avg_pickup_minutes
FROM time_taken_cte
WHERE pickup_minutes > 1
GROUP BY runner_id;

**8. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**

WITH time_taken_cte AS

  SELECT 
    c.order_id,
  	COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS numberofpizza,

SELECT CORR (pickup_minutes, numberofpizza)
from time_taken_cte;

**9. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**

SELECT 
  runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(
    CASE WHEN cancellation is Null THEN 0
    ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS success_perc
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;

**10. What was the most commonly added extra?**

WITH toppings_cte AS (
SELECT
  pizza_id,
  REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(toppings, '[,\s]+')::INTEGER AS topping_id
FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes)

SELECT

LIMIT 3;

**12. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?**

SELECT CONCAT('$', SUM(CASE
                           WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
                           ELSE 10

INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names USING (pizza_id)
INNER JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id)

**13. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras? Add cheese is $1 extra**

SELECT CONCAT('$', topping_revenue+ pizza_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM
  (SELECT SUM(CASE
                  WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
                  ELSE 10
              END) AS pizza_revenue,

      INNER JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id)
      WHERE cancellation IS NULL
      ORDER BY order_id)t1) t2;

**14. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.**

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_rating;

CREATE TABLE runner_rating (order_id INTEGER, rating INTEGER, review VARCHAR(100)) ;

-- Order 6 and 9 were cancelled

INSERT INTO runner_rating

VALUES ('1', '1', 'Really bad service'),
       ('2', '1', NULL),
       ('3', '4', 'Took too long..."),
       ('4', '1','Runner was lost, delivered it AFTER an hour. Pizza arrived cold' ),
       ('5', '2', ''Good service'),
       ('7', '5', 'It was great, good service and fast'),
       ('8', '2', 'He tossed it on the doorstep, poor service'),
       ('10', '5', 'Delicious!, he delivered it sooner than expected too!');


SELECT *
FROM runner_rating;
